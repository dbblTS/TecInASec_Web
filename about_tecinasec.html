			<h2>User Characteristics</h2>
			<hr />
			<p>TecInASec is made to be as simple as possible to use, there is not any extensive technical knowledge required, nor experience. The optimal user group would be users that have had some previous experience with using entry fields to fill in information, and users that understand that the software isn&rsquo;t written by professionals, as there could occur errors if the user were to input something that we did not take into account whilst developing the software. Even though we have done our very best to make the software as optimal, and error-free as possible!</p>
			<br />
			<h2>Product Design</h2>
			<hr />
			<p>The design of the product is set to be as user friendly as possible. The reasoning behind this is because we want the target market to feel at ease with the software at first glance. All of the elements on the GUI are optional; as long as at least one of the fields is filled in the user will get a result. The appearance of the application is a likeness to the simple practical aspects of the program. The established iteration of the product is not too simple where as it would be boring and bleak but again not too vibrant and distracting thus to keep the user from detracting the attention away from the intentions of the application.</p>
